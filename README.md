  Data Workspace is an open source data analysis platform with features for users with a range of technical skills. Features include:

  - a data catalogue for users to discover, filter, and download data
  - a permission system that allows users to only access specific datasets
  - a framework for hosting tools that allows users to analyse data without downloading it, such as through JupyterLab, RStudio, or Theia (a VS Code-like IDE)
  - dashboard creation and hosting
