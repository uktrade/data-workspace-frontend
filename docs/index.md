    **Data Workspace** is an easy-to-use data platform within the Department for Business and Trade that allows users to intuitively work with their data. It includes the following features:

    - Use your data to do analysis in Data Workspace tools such as RStudio, JupyterLab or Theia
    - Preview, filter and download data using the enhanced preview feature.
    - Design your own dashboards using data visualisation tools. 

    Data Workspace can also be ran locally by those outside of the Department for Business and Trade.
